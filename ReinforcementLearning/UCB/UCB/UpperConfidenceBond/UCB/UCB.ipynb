    "    chat gpt will break down this\n",
    "    Let me explain the line `numbers_selected[ad] += 1` in detail for your scenario. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables in Context:\n",
    "1. **`numbers_selected`**:\n",
    "   - It is a list of size `d` (10 in this case).\n",
    "   - Each index represents an ad (from 0 to 9).\n",
    "   - The value at each index indicates how many times the corresponding ad has been selected by the algorithm so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example (initially): \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers_selected = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`ad`**:\n",
    "   - This is the index of the ad with the highest **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** for the current iteration. \n",
    "   - When an ad is selected, we increment its count in `numbers_selected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`numbers_selected[ad] += 1`**:\n",
    "   - After selecting the ad `ad`, you increment its count in the `numbers_selected` list.\n",
    "   - This means the selected ad is chosen one more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the beginning:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers_selected = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # No ads selected yet\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration 1**:\n",
    "  - Assume `ad = 3` is selected (the ad with the highest UCB).\n",
    "  - `numbers_selected[ad] += 1` increments the value at index 3.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers_selected = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration 2**:\n",
    "  - Assume `ad = 7` is selected in this iteration.\n",
    "  - Increment the count for ad 7.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers_selected = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration 3**:\n",
    "  - Assume `ad = 3` is selected again.\n",
    "  - Increment the count for ad 3.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers_selected = [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, `numbers_selected` keeps track of how many times each ad has been shown to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This information is critical for calculating the **Upper Confidence Bound** (UCB) in future iterations:\n",
    "- If an ad has been selected many times, its UCB tends to decrease because we are more confident in its performance.\n",
    "- Ads that are less frequently selected get a higher UCB, encouraging exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm ensures a balance between **exploitation** (choosing ads with high rewards) and **exploration** (trying out less-selected ads).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "#finally it becomes numbers_selected = [8000, 500, 700, 300, 200, 100, 50, 50, 50, 50] the the highest value which is 8000 that index is the 0 . the 0 represent the first ad\n",
